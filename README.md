# Playing Atari Games with DQN

This project was developed as a final project for the Trends of AI course at ULB.

In order to run the project you need:
* Python 3.7
* Install python libraries: Thensorflow, Gym, Numpy.
* Jupyter Notebook

It consists on three scripts:
* *Graphs.ipynb* : it receives a trained-model.pck file containing an array of rewards and it plots the average rewards over time.
* *index.ipynb*: it contains the DQN script that trains the agent.
* *prod_model.ipynb*: it receives a ```trained-model.meta``` file that contains the already trained model meta information and it plays the Atari game using this model.
